<h1>privacy</h1>
<p>
  by using certain services that i have created, some of your data may be
  stored. here they are:
</p>
<h2>my homepage (tauon.dev) and wiki (wiki.tauon.dev)</h2>
<p>
  when you visit any page on these sites, your IP address, user agent, and the
  file you accessed, are logged. this is the default behaviour of nginx, and it
  will stay enabled for me to diagnose if i am being attacked.
</p>
<h2>Motion JPEG experiments (mjpeg.tauon.dev)</h2>
<p>
  the information for the tauon.dev applies, due to the servers for the Motion
  JPEG experiments being reverse-proxied through nginx.
</p>
<p>
  additionally, a hashed version of your IP is stored in an in-memory database,
  in order to determine which functions you have accessed on each experiment.
</p>
{% if site.is_lazy %}
<h2>buttonproxy (buttonproxy.tauon.dev)</h2>
<p>
  as a user of this service (i.e., you just browse to / on my server and load
  some of the 88x31s), nothing other than what is stated under tauon.dev
  happens. as a webmaster (i.e., someone who runs a website that contains an
  88x31 that is listed on this site), your 88x31 is stored on disc on the
  server. that's, like, the same as what happens if i just save it the non-lazy
  way, but if you don't want this, block buttonproxy in your
  <code>robots.txt</code> file. then, mail me at (my name)@(the domain of this
  site) to remove the files that may have been stored.
</p>
