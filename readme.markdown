this is a website written in eleventy

the commands are:
- `yarn build`: build for production
- `yarn serve`: build and serve for dev
- `yarn update`: update, install dependencies, and build (for server)

additionally, you may do dynamic data in the `prebuild.js` file. this currently
refreshes owned 88x31s, and refreshes geometry dash data. it could,
perhaps, get the site's build date and commit hash.
